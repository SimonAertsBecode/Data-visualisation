
CONSTRAINT: !! SI JS EST DISABLED THE GRAPH SHOULD NOT APPEAR !!

	    !! the graph must be between h1 and article

	    ! Can't edit HTML
	    ! Use most relevant graph
	    ! Max 2 library


- inserer un graph au dessus de chaque tableau (data visu) pour exo 1

- recup datas (qui se trouvent Ã  cet url: https://canvasjs.com/services/data/datapoints.php)
 with ajax --> use it to make a graph that refresh every sec. pour exo 2.


---------------------- HOW WE GONE DO THIS ------------------------------------


- use a js library (should be easier) --> "chart.js" or "ToastUI-Chart".

- be logical in resolve: 1.DOM(access right place)  
			 			 2.Retrieve data 
			 			 3.Generate graph
---> commit at each step.


1) Understand what's ajax.
ajax: loads in data without refreshing the browser (ex: facebook message).

2) chart.js
Need container for canvas (width: ...%)
put chart in div between h1 and graph? document.getElement...?
