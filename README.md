# Data-visualisation

Things to know:

- the HTML was already done
- We couldn't modify the HTML file (we had to use DOM manipulation with js to do so).
- **IF** javascript is disabled, the chart should NOT appear.

Technology used:

- Javascript
- Chart.js
- AJAX/Fetch

The challenge here divided in two parts.

**first challenge:** We had to fetch datas from an external source (PHP link) and implement it in a chart, to be able to visualise them. The tricky part was to refresh/update the datas each second, and make it appear in the chart.

You can find this chart just under the main title (h1) at the beginning of the doc.

**Second challenge:** You can find two tables with datas in th HTML file. The goal was to retrieve these datas with js and make a chart with it. Once it was done, through js we had to manipulate the DOM and insert those graphs just above its respective table.
